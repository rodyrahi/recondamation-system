## 📖 Project Overview
The **Recondamation System** applies data science and machine learning techniques to build a recommendation system that predicts user preferences. It leverages collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid modeling to produce highly accurate recommendations.

## 🌟 Features
- **Data Processing:** Advanced data cleaning and transformation techniques.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset.
- **Recommendation Techniques:** Utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based methods.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Includes RMSE, MAE, and precision/recall scoring to evaluate model performance.
- **Deployment-Ready Code:** Easily integrates with web applications for live recommendations.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data processing
- **scikit-learn** for model development
- **NLTK** for text processing (if using textual features)
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization

## 📂 Dataset
This system is designed for user-item interaction datasets. Examples of public datasets include:
- [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
- [Amazon Product Reviews](https://registry.opendata.aws/amazon-reviews/)

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rodyrahi/recondamation-system.git
   cd recondamation-system
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage
1. **Data Preparation:** Load and preprocess data by running the preprocessing scripts.
2. **Training Models:** Run `train_model.py` to train recommendation models.
3. **Evaluation:** Measure performance using `evaluate.py`.
4. **Generating Recommendations:** Use `predict.py` to generate recommendations for users.

## 🧠 Modeling Approach
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Uses both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Incorporates item features and user profiles to tailor recommendations.
- **Hybrid Model:** Merges collaborative and content-based methods to enhance accuracy and relevance.

## 📊 Results
The recommendation system has been tested on multiple datasets and provides reliable, relevant recommendations with high accuracy based on precision, recall, and F1-scores.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Implementation of neural collaborative filtering
- Support for real-time, streaming recommendations
- Integration with a web frontend for live deployment
